# Random-Forest-Classifier-on-Glass-Dataset
This project is taken as an example implementation to understand and apply the Random Forest algorithm for classification tasks. Using the Glass dataset, it demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, evaluation, and comparison with Bagging and Boosting methods
